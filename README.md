## What

VATPRC-UniSequence is a sequence helper for controllers to manage their aircraft list, and arrange their order.

## How

VATPRC-UniSequence will manage all of your tags, you just need to set their status, and the sorting will be automatically managed by the plugin. Of course, you can sort it yourself if you need to.

## Why

VATPRC-UniSequence aims to reduce the waste of frequency resources and controller time caused by crews frequently asking for their sequence number. So that both sides can have a better experience in flight events.

## Hand book

For more information (how to use for example), please refer to [github wiki of this project](https://github.com/Ericple/VATPRC-UniSequence/wiki/1.-Introduction)

## Developing

[Vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/), either standalone or bundled with Visual Studio v17.6+, is required. Run `vcpkg integrate install` in Visual Studio CMD/Powershell and build directly.
